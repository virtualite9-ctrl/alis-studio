# Alis Studio

A local, **model-agnostic** image-generation studio for **Apple silicon** — a clean, native-feeling
web UI that runs text-to-image models entirely on your Mac with [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).
No cloud, no accounts, your images never leave your machine.

Ships with **[Krea 2 Turbo](https://github.com/avlp12/krea2_alis_mlx)** (pure-MLX), plus
**Qwen-Image** and **FLUX.1** (schnell / dev) via [mflux](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux).
More models plug in as small backends — see [Adding a model](#adding-a-model).

> Everything in one place: **pick or download a model**, then set resolution + aspect ratio, steps,
> seed, and more in the model-adaptive settings panel. Light and dark follow your system.

## Quickstart

**Requires an Apple-silicon Mac (M1+) with ≥ 24 GB unified memory.** On macOS use `python3`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avlp12/alis-studio.git
cd alis-studio
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py            # opens http://localhost:7860 in your browser
```

Type a prompt, pick a model, click **Generate**. The first run downloads the model weights from
Hugging Face (a few minutes); after that it's instant to start. A 1024² image takes ~50 s on an
M3 Ultra (8-step Turbo; slower chips take longer).

- **Detailed settings** — a model-adaptive panel on the right: resolution with aspect-ratio
  presets, steps, batch size, seed (with randomize), guidance, sampler, negative prompt. Each
  model exposes exactly the controls it supports; the panel renders itself from the backend.
- **Model manager** — the **Models** button (top-right) opens a manager to browse, **download**
  (with a live progress bar), and delete model weights, and see total disk usage.
- **Live progress** — a per-step bar as the model denoises. **Light + dark** follow your system.
- **NSFW safety filter** runs by default (pure-MLX, no PyTorch); toggle it with the shield icon.
- Bind to your LAN with `ALIS_HOST=0.0.0.0 python3 app.py` (only on networks you trust); change
  the port with `ALIS_PORT=7861`.

## Models

The **Model** section in Settings (and the whole settings panel) is built from whatever backends are
installed — the UI discovers them at startup via `/api/models` and `/api/catalog`, so adding a model
needs no UI changes. Each model's builds are grouped under its name; switch with **Use**, manage
downloads inline, and the previous build is freed when you switch (two big models won't fit at once).

| Model | Builds | Download |
|---|---|---|
| **Krea 2 Turbo** | 8-bit (14.2 GB) · mixed-4/8 (9.8 GB). 8-step Turbo. | managed in-app (resumable, with progress) |
| **Qwen-Image** | 8/4-bit, bf16. Apache-2.0, open. | auto on first use via mflux (~40 GB) |
| **FLUX.1 schnell** | 8/4-bit, bf16. Apache-2.0 weights, **gated repo**. | auto on first use via mflux (~24 GB) |
| **FLUX.1 dev** | 8/4-bit, bf16. Non-commercial, **gated**. | auto on first use via mflux (~24 GB) |

Krea 2 Turbo ships **explicit** download management (our own resumable HTTP-bridge downloader with a
live progress bar). The FLUX / Qwen-Image backends are handled by [mflux](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux),
which downloads the weights on first **Generate**. The **FLUX** repos are **gated** — accept the
license on Hugging Face and run `huggingface-cli login` first, or Alis Studio shows an actionable
error. Qwen-Image is open and needs no access.

## Adding a model

Drop a file in `studio/backends/`, subclass `Backend`, and register it. The backend *declares*
its settings (`params`) and downloadable builds (`catalog`); the UI renders the settings panel and
the model manager from those declarations — no UI code to touch.

```python
# studio/backends/mymodel.py
from .base import Backend

class MyBackend(Backend):
    id = "my-model"
    label = "My Model"
    variants = [{"id": "default", "label": "default"}]
    # settings the UI renders into the right-hand panel (see studio/backends/base.py for all types):
    params = [
        {"key": "resolution", "label": "Resolution", "type": "resolution", "group": "Output",
         "sizes": [512, 1024], "default_size": 1024, "aspects": ["1:1", "3:2", "16:9"],
         "default_aspect": "1:1", "min": 256, "max": 1536, "multiple": 16},
        {"key": "steps", "label": "Steps", "type": "int", "group": "Output", "min": 1, "max": 50, "default": 20},
        {"key": "guidance", "label": "Guidance", "type": "float", "group": "Sampling",
         "min": 0, "max": 12, "step": 0.5, "default": 7.5},
        {"key": "seed", "label": "Seed", "type": "seed", "group": "Sampling", "default": 0},
    ]
    catalog = [{"variant": "default", "label": "default", "size_gb": 6.0, "note": "fp16"}]

    @classmethod
    def is_available(cls):
        try:
            import my_package  # noqa
            return True
        except Exception:
            return False

    def generate(self, *, prompt, variant, params, step_callback):
        # params carries width, height, steps, seed, num_images + your custom keys.
        # call step_callback(step, total) per denoising step for the live progress bar.
        return [pil_image, ...]

    # optional — enables the model manager's download / delete / installed state:
    def is_installed(self, variant): ...
    def download(self, variant, progress): ...   # call progress(done_bytes, total_bytes)
    def delete(self, variant): ...
```

Then add it to `studio/registry.py`:

```python
from .backends.mymodel import MyBackend
BACKENDS = [Krea2Backend, MyBackend]
```

Backends whose dependencies aren't installed are skipped automatically, so the app always runs
with whatever you have.

## How it works

- `app.py` → `studio/server.py` — a Python **standard-library** HTTP server (zero web dependencies).
  Serves `web/index.html` and a small JSON/NDJSON API:
  - `GET /api/models` — registered models + their settings schema (drives the dropdown + settings panel)
  - `POST /api/generate` — streams NDJSON: one line per denoising step, then the base64 PNGs
  - `GET /api/catalog` · `POST /api/download` (streamed progress) · `POST /api/delete` — the model manager
- `studio/registry.py` — the list of available models.
- `studio/backends/` — one file per model; each wraps a model behind the small `Backend` interface.
- `studio/download.py` — the resilient HTTP-bridge downloader (resumable, integrity-checked).

Generation is serialized (one GPU, one job at a time). The NSFW filter is applied at the app level
to every backend's output, reusing Krea 2's pure-MLX classifier.

the Krea 2 Turbo backend uses weights under the
[Krea 2 Community License](https://krea.ai/krea-2-licensing) (commercial use requires annual revenue
under $1M; content filtering required for deployments — the built-in filter is on by default). You're
